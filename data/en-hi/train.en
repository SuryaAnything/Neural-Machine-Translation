"The Mahabharata itself (1. 1. 61) distinguishes a core portion of 24, 000 verses, the Bharata proper, as opposed to additional secondary material, while the Ashvalayana Grhyasutra (3. 4. 4) makes a similar distinction. At least three redactions of the text are commonly recognized: Jaya (Victory) with 8, 800 verses attributed to Vyasa, Bharata with 24, 000 verses as recited by Vaisampayana, and finally the Mahabharata as recited by Ugrasrava Sauti with over 100, 000 verses. [8] [9] However, some scholars such as John Brockington, argue that Jaya and Bharata refer to the same text, and ascribe the theory of Jaya with 8, 800 verses to a misreading of a verse in Adiparvan (1. 1. 81). [10] The redaction of this large body of text was carried out after formal principles, emphasizing the numbers 18 and 12."

"Erdoğan and Assad in happier times. < s > Erdoğan 's actions fit into a context going back a half - century. During the Cold War, Ankara stood with Washington as a member of NATO even as Damascus served as Moscow' s Cuba of the Middle East, an arch - reliable client state. Bad Turkish - Syrian relations also had local sources, including a border dispute, disagreement over water resources, and Syrian backing of the PKK, a Kurdish terrorist group. The two states reached the brink of war in 1998, when the Assad government 's timely capitulation averted armed conflict. < s > A new era began in November 2002 when Erdoğan' s AKP, a clever Islamist party that avoids terrorism and rants about a global caliphate, replaced the center - right and - left parties that long had dominated Ankara. Governing competently and overseeing an unprecedented economic boom, the AKP 's share of the electorate grew from one - third in 2002 to one - half in 2011.
