"But far and away the most famous of the early clubs was Hambledon in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord 's Cricket Ground in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman John Small and the first great fast bowler Thomas Brett.

It was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old “”hockey stick“” style of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed along the ground."
